### Query Builders

Query builders in PyroCMS work just the same as [query builders in Laravel](https://laravel.com/docs/5.3/queries) with the addition of a few cool features.

#### Caching Queries

The query builder in PyroCMS provides a direct API for storing query results in the model's `cache collection`. The `cache collection` is automatically cleared when the model's table is altered in any way (such as saving, deleting, etc).

To enable query cacheing you must first set `DB_CACHE=true` in your `.env` file and set the cache lifetime.

You can set the cache lifetime in `seconds` by using the `ttl` method:

    $results = $model->where('status', true)->cache(300)->get();

You can also define the `$ttl` property on the model you are using for the query:

    protected $ttl = 300;

<div class="alert alert-info">**Note:** Caching queries uses the resulting query string including bindings to determine uniqueness.</div>

##### Fetching Fresh Results

If you are leveraging query caching you may want to temporarily omit cache. You can do this by using the `fresh` method.

    $results = $model->where('status', true)->fresh()->get();
